A somewhat useful role-playing game assistant.  This dropwizard service has the following features:

* dice roller
* random quotes
* settlement generator
* rate of travel table
* weather generator

Many of these features are inspired by the content in the "World of Greyhawk" boxed set from TSR, 1983.
